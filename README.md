🚀 DevOps Project: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and AWS.

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline integrating automation, containerization, infrastructure-as-code, and cloud deployment. The goal was to design a scalable, automated deployment workflow for a sample Java application.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
CI/CD: Jenkins

Containerization: Docker
Infrastructure: AWS EC2, Terraform
Configuration Management: Ansible
Version Control: Git & GitHub

🧱 Project Architecture
Developer → GitHub → Jenkins (CI/CD) → Docker → Terraform (AWS EC2) → Ansible (Remote Deployment)

🔧 Features & Workflow
✅ Source Control
Codebase managed with Git and hosted on GitHub.

✅ CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
Configured a multistage Jenkins pipeline for build, test, and deploy.
Automated build and deployment on code push.

✅ Docker
Dockerized a sample Java application (Spring Boot or basic REST API).
Created Dockerfiles and managed images.

✅ AWS Deployment
Used Terraform to provision AWS EC2 instances.
Setup security groups and key pairs.

✅ Configuration Management
Used Ansible to install dependencies and deploy the Docker container remotely.
